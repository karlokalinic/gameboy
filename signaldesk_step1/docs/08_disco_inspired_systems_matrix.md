# Disco-Inspired Systems Matrix (Your Version, Not Clone)

## What to borrow (principles)
- Build identity changes text perception
- Failure produces content, not just punishment
- Internal psychology is mechanical, not decorative
- Dialogue is gameplay, not exposition wrapper

## What NOT to copy literally
- exact skill list
- exact thought cabinet names/effects
- exact narrative voice style
- exact UI motifs

## Your equivalent systems (V1-V3 path)

### A) Inventory (evidence-first)
**Disco influence:** items as expressive modifiers and gating keys
**Your version:** evidence/tool/credential/symbolic items affect logs, access, checks, and narrative framing

### B) Thought Cabinet (internal frameworks)
**Disco influence:** internalization with mechanical cost/benefit
**Your version:** operator doctrines / obsessions / coping frameworks that alter overlays, checks, relationships, heat, sanity

### C) Consequence architecture
**Disco influence:** dialogue failures shape identity and outcomes
**Your version:** consequence bands + delayed returns through district state, contact memory, faction heat

### D) Character creator/build identity
**Disco influence:** build defines available cognition/perception
**Your version:** archetype + signature skill + background + starting thought changes UI hints, overlays, options, and risk profile

### E) Open world progression
**Disco influence:** broad area-based nonlinearity and layered side content
**Your version:** district graph + thread availability + time and surveillance pressure in desktop interface

### F) Multiple endings
**Disco influence:** endings reflect more than one final choice
**Your version:** synthesized ending across case/world/relationships/mental state/thoughts

## Long-term possibility list (explicitly requested "više possibilities")
Ovo ne ide sve u V1, ali planiraj API da kasnije stane:
- hidden agendas per contact (state machine)
- faction reputation axes (fear/respect/usefulness)
- phone call mini-negotiation subsystem
- interrogation pressure timeline bars
- media narrative layer (public story vs truth)
- evidence chain integrity (court / audit survivability)
- false-memory contamination events (sanity interactions)
- procedural corruption web (who protects whom)
- ideological thought conflicts (mutually exclusive thought sets)
- companion/contact temporary co-op actions via remote channels
- New Game+ memory echoes / unlock thoughts
